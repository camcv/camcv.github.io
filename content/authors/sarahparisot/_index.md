I am a Principal Researcher in the Game Intelligence (opens in new tab) team which develops novel machine learning technology with applications to video games and beyond. My research interests and experience include parameter efficient learning, computer vision and generative AI. My recent work has focused on text-to-image generative models, with an emphasis on controllability and interactivity.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I was a Senior Research Scientist and Team Leader at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab in London.
