 I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge. I'm building a research team focused on computer vision and dynamic 3D world modeling, with applications across controllable generative media, robotics, and biology. Our goal is to model the dynamic physical 3D world from raw, sparse, and multimodal observations, including images, videos, and audio.

Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford University, working with Jiajun Wu. I completed my PhD in the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford, advised by Andrea Vedaldi and Christian Rupprecht, and my BSc in Computer Science from HKUST, where I worked with Chi-Keung Tang and Yu-Wing Tai.
