summary: 
abstract: Great pleasure to host Prof [Benjamin Busam](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/busam-benjamin) from [Technical University of Munich, Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/pf/home/) and Principal Researcher [Sarah Parisot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sarahparisot/) from [Microsoft, Game Intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/game-intelligence/) in our CV4DT lab this week 🎓!  <br> <br> Benjamin has presented his excellent research in the 3D computer vision, in our talk centering on photometric challenges and trends in object pose estimation. He also showed his group's research direction towards geometrically-accurate, photorealistic and physically-plausible 3D digitization.  <br>  <br> Sarah took us on the fantastic journey of world models. Her focus is on turning actions and 2D game observations into an immersive gaming experience allowing for versatile interaction with objects. She has also revealed that there is plenty new directions (3D) to explore within this still relatively new research direction!  <br>  <br> Super excited about building new bridges to people in Cambridge (Sarah at Microsoft) and maintaining the old bridges to new leaders of my previous lab in Munich (Benjamin at Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing Chair)!  <br>  <br> Feel free to reach out to explore potential collaborations! Stay tuned for more from the [CV4DT](https://cv4dt.github.io/) and [CAMCV](https://camcv.github.io/)!
